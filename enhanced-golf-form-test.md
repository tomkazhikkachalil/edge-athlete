# Enhanced Golf Form System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Summary

The enhanced golf form system has been successfully implemented with both Round Recap and Hole Highlight modes as requested:

### 🏗️ **Database Schema**
- **golf_rounds table**: Stores round data (date, course, tee, holes, gross_score, etc.)
- **golf_holes table**: Stores hole-by-hole data with FK to rounds
- **Updated posts table**: Links to golf_rounds and includes golf_mode and hole_number
- **RLS policies**: Secure user-owned data access
- **Functions**: Auto-calculation of round stats from holes, completion tracking

- ✅ Date (required) with date picker
- ✅ Course name (required) with search suggestions from popular courses

`"Pebble Beach Golf Links — Hole 7 — Birdie"`
`"Hole 12 — Eagle"` (if no course)

### 🗃️ **Data Integration**

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Round Recap Flow**
1. Select "Round Recap" mode
2. Enter date, course (with search), select 18 holes
3. Enter score 82, FIR 71%, GIR 58%, 32 putts
4. Add round notes
5. Caption suggestion: "Course • 82 (+10) • FIR 71% | GIR 58% | 32 putts"
6. **Expected**: Creates golf_rounds record, posts with round_id

### **Test 2: Hole Highlight Flow**
1. Select "Hole Highlight" mode  
2. Enter date, select hole 7, set par 4
3. Enter 3 strokes (birdie), 1 putt, fairway hit, GIR
4. Caption suggestion: "Hole 7 — Birdie"
5. **Expected**: Creates/finds round, creates golf_holes record, posts with round_id + hole_number

### **Test 3: Existing Round Attachment**
1. Create round recap for "Pebble Beach" on "2024-03-15"
2. Later, create hole highlight for same course/date
3. **Expected**: Hole highlight attaches to existing round, doesn't create duplicate

### **Test 4: Course Search**
1. Type "pebb" in course field
2. **Expected**: Shows "Pebble Beach Golf Links" in dropdown
3. Click suggestion
4. **Expected**: Field populated, dropdown closes

### **Test 5: Validation**
