# Development Log

## April 7, 2026

### Feed & Login Cleanup
Removed all placeholder/fake UI that was misleading for early users.

**Feed page (`src/app/feed/page.tsx`):**
- Removed fake Stories section (hardcoded "Athlete 1–6" placeholders)
- Removed Explore Reels placeholder grid
- Replaced Upcoming Events with honest empty state ("coming soon")
- Replaced Your Teams with Your Club empty state ("coming soon")
- Wired Photo/Video, Stats, Achievement quick-action buttons to open the create post modal (were styled but had no `onClick` handlers)

**Login page (`src/app/page.tsx`):**
- Removed Google, Facebook, Apple OAuth buttons — they had no click handlers and did nothing on press. Email/password login is the primary auth method for the MVP.

### Mobile App Crash Fix
Fixed a crash that prevented the app from loading on mobile devices entirely.

**Root Cause:** `src/app/layout.tsx` loaded Tailwind CSS from CDN via `<script async>`, followed by an inline script setting `tailwind.config = {...}`. On slow mobile connections, the CDN script hadn't loaded when the inline script ran, causing `ReferenceError: tailwind is not defined` — crashing the entire React tree.

**Fix:** Removed both scripts. Tailwind CSS 4 is already fully compiled at build time via `@tailwindcss/postcss` — the CDN script was redundant.

---

### Black Media Images Fix (Tailwind CSS v3 → v4 Migration)
Fixed all media images appearing as solid black squares in post feeds and the profile media grid.

**Root Cause (two layers):**

1. **`LazyImage` component** used an IntersectionObserver + `opacity-0` initial state. If `onLoad` was slow, images stayed invisible on top of the `bg-black` media container in `PostCard`.

2. **Tailwind CSS v3 → v4 breaking change** — `bg-opacity-*` utilities were removed in Tailwind CSS 4. After removing the CDN v3 script, every `bg-black bg-opacity-0` rendered as solid black at full opacity. The media grid overlay (`absolute inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-0`) was a black sheet covering every image. This also broke all modal backdrops, carousel buttons, and hover overlays across the entire app.

**Fixes:**
- `LazyImage`: Replaced IntersectionObserver + opacity trick with a gray skeleton overlay (`z-10`) that sits on top while the image loads. Image always renders so `onLoad` fires reliably.
- `PostCard`: Changed media container from `bg-black` → `bg-gray-100` (neutral fallback).
- Global: Replaced all `bg-opacity-*` / `hover:bg-opacity-*` / `group-hover:bg-opacity-*` with Tailwind v4 slash syntax (`bg-black/50`, `hover:bg-black/70`, etc.) across **25 files**.

### Build-Breaking Fix: Module-Level Supabase Clients
Fixed production build failures caused by Supabase clients being created at module scope in API routes. During static analysis, Next.js evaluates module-level code where environment variables aren't available, causing `supabaseUrl is required` errors.

**Root Cause:** 26 API route files created Supabase admin clients (`createClient(...)`) at the top of the file outside request handlers.

**Fix:**
- Added `getSupabaseAdmin()` lazy factory function to `src/lib/auth-server.ts`
- Moved all Supabase client creation inside request handler `try` blocks
- Replaced module-level env var constants with inline `process.env` references

**Files Changed (27):**
- `src/lib/auth-server.ts` — Added `getSupabaseAdmin()` helper
- 26 API routes under `src/app/api/` — Moved client init into handlers

### Golf Stats Endpoint Fix
Fixed `/api/golf/stats` returning 500 errors due to querying a non-existent `total_score` column.

**Fix:** Removed `total_score` from the SELECT query and all calculation references in `src/app/api/golf/stats/route.ts`. The correct column is `gross_score`.

### Notification Routes Auth Fix
Fixed all notification API routes returning 500 instead of 401 for unauthenticated requests.

**Root Cause:** `requireAuth()` throws a `Response` object on auth failure, but catch blocks didn't check for it, wrapping the 401 as a generic 500.

**Fix:** Added `if (error instanceof Response) return error;` to catch blocks in 7 handlers across 5 files:
- `notifications/route.ts` (GET, DELETE)
- `notifications/unread-count/route.ts` (GET)
- `notifications/preferences/route.ts` (GET, PATCH)
- `notifications/mark-all-read/route.ts` (PATCH)
- `notifications/[id]/route.ts` (PATCH, DELETE)
- `notifications/[id]/action/route.ts` (POST)

**Verification:**
- Build: Passing (57 pages, 54 API routes, 0 errors)
- Lint: No warnings or errors
- All 22 database tables accessible
- All notification endpoints return 401 for unauthenticated requests

### Mobile Navigation Fix
Fixed non-functional buttons in the mobile navigation drawer:

**Before:** "Explore" and "Fans" buttons had no click handlers
**After:** Replaced with working navigation links:
- **Saved Posts** → `/athlete/saved`
- **Notifications** → `/app/notifications`

**File Changed:** `src/components/MobileNav.tsx`

---

### Connection Suggestions Feature Fix
Fixed the "People you may know" suggestions feature which was failing due to SQL issues:

**Root Cause:**
- Multiple versions of `generate_connection_suggestions` function with different return types
- Missing `connection_suggestions` table for dismiss functionality
- RPC function parameter names mismatch between API and database

**Changes Made:**

1. **Created comprehensive migration:** `database/migrations/fix-suggestions-feature-complete.sql`
   - Creates `connection_suggestions` table with proper schema
   - Adds RLS policies for the new table
   - Drops all old function versions
   - Creates corrected `generate_connection_suggestions` function
   - Adds proper indexes for performance

2. **Improved API route:** `src/app/api/suggestions/route.ts`
   - Added TypeScript interface for `ConnectionSuggestion`
   - Fixed RPC parameter names (`p_user_profile_id`, `p_suggestion_limit`)
   - Improved fallback logic to exclude already-followed profiles
   - Better error logging with structured error details
   - Created Supabase client per-request instead of module level

**To Apply:**
Run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor:
```
database/migrations/fix-suggestions-feature-complete.sql
```

**Database Schema Alignment:**
Also fixed `src/app/api/public/profile/route.ts` and `src/lib/supabase.ts`:
- Removed `position` and `team` from profile queries (not in current DB schema)
- Fixed golf rounds query to use `gross_score` instead of `total_score`

### Fan Terminology Update
Replaced all "Follow/Following/Followers" terminology with fan-based wording across the entire UI:

| Old Term | New Term |
|----------|----------|
| Follow | Become a Fan |
| Following (status) | You're a Fan |
| Following (list) | Fan Of |
| Followers | Fans |
| Follow request | Fan request |
| Unfollow | Unfollow (kept) |
| Remove Follower | Remove Fan |

**Files Updated (14 total):**
- `src/components/FollowButton.tsx`
- `src/components/FollowersModal.tsx`
- `src/components/PrivateProfileView.tsx`
- `src/components/NotificationsDropdown.tsx`
- `src/components/EditProfileTabs.tsx`
- `src/components/AppHeader.tsx`
- `src/components/MobileNav.tsx`
- `src/components/settings/AccountSettings.tsx`
- `src/app/athlete/page.tsx`
- `src/app/athlete/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/u/[username]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/notifications/page.tsx`
- `src/app/app/notifications/page.tsx`
- `src/app/app/followers/page.tsx`

### Enhanced Fans Modal
Implemented bidirectional relationship management in the Fans modal:

**On Your Own Profile (Fans List):**
- See all your fans with profile photo, name, sport/school
- "Become a Fan" button to follow them back
- "Unfollow" button if already following
- "Remove Fan" button to remove them from your fans
- All buttons always visible (no hover menus)

**On Another User's Profile (Fans List):**
- Discover fans of that athlete
- "Become a Fan" / "Unfollow" buttons for each person
- No "Remove Fan" button (owner-only privilege)

**Button Styles:**
- **Become a Fan**: Blue background (`bg-blue-600`)
- **Unfollow**: Gray background (`bg-gray-200`)
- **Remove Fan**: Red text on light red (`text-red-600 bg-red-50`)
