## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Requiring Attention (Pre-Launch)

### 1. Type Safety (Medium Priority)

**Issue**: ~100 instances of `any` type across components

**Impact**: Reduces type safety, can cause runtime errors

**Status**: In Progress
- ‚úÖ SearchBar.tsx - Fixed (created centralized types)
- ‚úÖ CreatePostModalSteps.tsx - Fixed
- ‚è≥ PostCard.tsx - ~44 warnings remaining
- ‚è≥ CreatePostModal.tsx - ~16 warnings remaining
- ‚è≥ MultiSportActivity.tsx - ~15 warnings remaining
- ‚è≥ Others - Various files

**Files Created**:
- `/src/types/search.ts` - Centralized search result types
- `/src/types/post.ts` - Post and media types

**Recommendation**: Continue systematic type replacement before launch

---

### 2. Performance Optimization (High Priority for SEO/UX)

**Issue**: Using `<img>` tags instead of Next.js `<Image />` component

**Impact**:
- Slower page load times
- Higher bandwidth usage
- Poor Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) scores
- No automatic image optimization

**Affected Files**:
- SearchBar.tsx (2 instances)
- AdvancedSearchBar.tsx (2 instances)
- CommentSection.tsx (1 instance)
- NotificationBell.tsx (1 instance)
- FollowersModal.tsx (1 instance)
- TagPeopleModal.tsx (1 instance)
- EditProfileModal.tsx (1 instance)
- CreatePostModalSteps.tsx (1 instance)
- LazyImage.tsx (1 instance - intentional?)

**Recommendation**: **HIGH PRIORITY** - Replace all `<img>` with `next/image` before production launch

---

### 3. React Hooks Dependencies (Low Priority)

**Issue**: Missing dependencies in `useEffect` hooks

**Impact**: Potential stale closures, unexpected behavior

**Status**:
- ‚úÖ SearchBar.tsx - Fixed with useCallback
- ‚è≥ EnhancedGolfForm.tsx - 2 warnings
- ‚è≥ FollowButton.tsx - 1 warning
- ‚è≥ FollowersModal.tsx - 2 warnings
- ‚è≥ MultiSportActivity.tsx - 1 warning
- ‚è≥ Others - Various files

**Recommendation**: Fix before launch to prevent unexpected behavior

---

### 4. Unused Variables (Low Priority)

**Issue**: Variables defined but never used

**Impact**: Bloats bundle size, confuses developers

**Examples**:
- CreatePostModalSteps.tsx: `golfData` (FIXED)
- MultiSportActivity.tsx: `_error` (prefix with _ is acceptable)
- WaitlistPopup.tsx: `_err`

**Recommendation**: Remove or prefix with underscore

---

### 5. Edge Runtime Warning (Informational Only)

**Issue**: Supabase Realtime uses Node.js APIs not supported in Edge Runtime

**Impact**: None for Vercel deployment (Node.js runtime is default)

**Status**: Expected behavior, not blocking

**Recommendation**: Monitor if planning to use Edge Runtime functions

---

## Database Health Check

### ‚úÖ Verified Connections

- [x] User profiles (public/private)
- [x] Posts with media attachments
- [x] Comments with likes
- [x] Follow system
- [x] Notifications
- [x] Golf rounds (indoor/outdoor)
- [x] Sport-specific settings
- [x] Season highlights
- [x] Saved posts

### Schema Status

All migrations appear to be applied correctly:
- `supabase-setup.sql` ‚úì
- `implement-privacy-system.sql` ‚úì
- `setup-saved-posts.sql` ‚úì
- `COMPLETE_GOLF_SETUP.sql` ‚úì
- `fix-likes-comments-issues.sql` ‚úì
- `COMPLETE_NAME_MIGRATION.sql` ‚úì
- `setup-all-notifications-complete.sql` ‚úì
- `add-comment-likes.sql` ‚úì
- `add-flexible-golf-rounds.sql` ‚úì
- `fix-profile-post-ordering.sql` ‚úì

---

## Responsive Design Status

**Current State**: Uses Tailwind responsive utilities throughout

**Tested Breakpoints**:
- Mobile: `sm:` prefix used extensively
- Tablet: `md:` prefix used where appropriate
- Desktop: Default styling

**Recommendation**: Perform manual testing on actual devices before launch
- iOS Safari (iPhone 14, 15)
- Android Chrome (various screen sizes)
- iPad (portrait/landscape)
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)

---

## Security & Compliance

### ‚úÖ Security Measures In Place

1. **Authentication**
   - Supabase Auth with secure session management
   - Password hashing handled by Supabase
   - Session refresh via middleware

2. **Authorization**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
   - Privacy-aware API routes
   - Owner-only access for editing/deleting

3. **Data Protection**
   - Environment variables for secrets (not hardcoded)
   - Service role key only used server-side
   - Media upload validation

4. **Privacy Controls**
   - Public/private profile visibility
   - Follow approval for private profiles
   - Post visibility settings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-Launch Security Checklist

- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set in Vercel
- [ ] Review RLS policies for edge cases
- [ ] Test file upload size limits (50MB enforced?)
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data in console.logs for production
- [ ] Add rate limiting to API routes (future enhancement)
- [ ] Consider adding CAPTCHA to signup (future enhancement)
- [ ] GDPR compliance review (if serving EU users)
