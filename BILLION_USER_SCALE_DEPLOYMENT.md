- [ ] **Check error rates** (should be unchanged or lower)
- [ ] **Verify user functionality** (all features working)

---

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Fix Duplicate Indexes (2 minutes)

**File:** `fix-duplicate-indexes-performance.sql`

**What it does:**
- Removes 5 redundant indexes across 5 tables
- Keeps the better/more specific index in each case
- Improves write performance immediately

**Execution:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `fix-duplicate-indexes-performance.sql`
3. Click **Run**
4. Wait for completion (~30 seconds)

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Dropped: idx_performances_date
✓ Dropped: idx_comments_post
✓ Dropped: idx_post_likes_post
✓ Dropped: idx_post_media_post_display
✓ Dropped: idx_posts_tags
Total indexes dropped: 5
✓ SUCCESS: Duplicate indexes removed!
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Should show 1 index per purpose (not 2)
SELECT tablename, indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('performances', 'post_comments', 'post_likes', 'post_media', 'posts')
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Faster INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- ✅ Reduced storage usage (~5-10 GB at scale)
- ✅ Lower maintenance overhead

---

### Step 2: Fix RLS InitPlan Performance (5 minutes)

**File:** `fix-rls-initplan-performance.sql`

**What it does:**
- Changes `auth.uid()` to `(select auth.uid())` in ~70 RLS policies
- Prevents InitPlan overhead (per-row function evaluation)
- Consolidates multiple policies into single policies per operation
- **THIS IS THE BIGGEST PERFORMANCE WIN**

**Execution:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `fix-rls-initplan-performance.sql`
3. Click **Run**
4. Wait for completion (~2-3 minutes)

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Fixed: posts (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: profiles (2 policies)
✓ Fixed: post_likes (3 policies)
✓ Fixed: post_comments (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: comment_likes (3 policies)
✓ Fixed: saved_posts (3 policies)
✓ Fixed: follows (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: notifications (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: notification_preferences (3 policies)
✓ Fixed: golf_rounds (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: golf_holes (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: group_posts (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: group_post_participants (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: hockey_game_data (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: volleyball_match_data (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: post_media (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: season_highlights (4 policies)
✓ Fixed: performances (4 policies)

✓ SUCCESS: All RLS policies optimized!
Total policies optimized: ~70+
✓ Database is now optimized for billion-user scale
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check query plans now use cached subquery instead of InitPlan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE profile_id = auth.uid() LIMIT 10;

-- Should show: "InitScan" once at top, NOT repeated in filters
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ **10-100x faster queries** on large tables
- ✅ Seq Scans → Index Scans (massive improvement)
- ✅ Query times reduced from seconds to milliseconds
- ✅ **This alone makes billion-user scale possible**

---

### Step 3: Verify Policy Consolidation (2 minutes)

**File:** `POLICY_CONSOLIDATION_ANALYSIS.md`

**What to check:**

Run this verification query:

```sql
-- Find any remaining tables with multiple policies per operation
SELECT
  tablename,
  cmd AS operation,
  COUNT(*) AS policy_count,
  array_agg(policyname) AS policy_names
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename, cmd
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY policy_count DESC, tablename, cmd;
```

**Expected result:**
- **Zero rows** or only a few special-case tables
- If you see many results, Step 2 may have failed

**If you see remaining duplicates:**

1. Check `POLICY_CONSOLIDATION_ANALYSIS.md` for table-specific fixes
2. Most common remaining tables:
   - `golf_scorecard_data` (if you have shared rounds)
   - `golf_participant_scores`
   - `golf_hole_scores`
   - `sport_settings`
   - `athlete_badges`
3. Create targeted migration for those specific tables (examples in analysis doc)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Faster policy evaluation (2-10x improvement)
- ✅ Better query optimization by PostgreSQL
- ✅ Reduced CPU usage per query

---

### Step 4: Configure Auth Settings (5 minutes)

**Manual configuration in Supabase Dashboard**

#### 4a. Enable Leaked Password Protection

**Path:** Authentication → Providers → Password

1. Scroll to **"Leaked Password Protection"**
2. Toggle to **ON**
3. Click **Save**

**What it does:** Blocks passwords found in data breaches (HaveIBeenPwned API)

---

#### 4b. Enable MFA Options

**Path:** Authentication → MFA

1. Enable **TOTP** (Time-based One-Time Password)
   - Recommended for MVP
   - Works with Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.
2. Optional: Enable **Phone/SMS** (requires SMS provider setup)
3. Optional: Enable **WebAuthn** (hardware keys, biometrics)
4. Click **Save**

**What it does:** Adds two-factor authentication option for users

---

#### 4c. Upgrade Postgres Version

**Path:** Settings → Infrastructure → Database

⚠️ **Warning:** This is the ONLY step with potential downtime (2-5 minutes)

1. Check for available upgrades
2. **Verify automatic backup is enabled** (should be)
3. Click **"Upgrade"**
4. **Schedule during off-peak hours** if possible
5. Monitor progress (2-5 minutes)
6. Verify database connectivity after upgrade

**What it does:**
- Applies latest security patches
- Improves performance
- Fixes known bugs

---

### Step 5: Verify Supabase Advisor (1 minute)

**Path:** Dashboard → Database → Advisor

Refresh the page and verify:

#### Security Tab
- [ ] **0 ERROR-level issues**
- [ ] **0 WARN-level issues** (except non-critical auth config if you skipped MFA/leaked password)

#### Performance Tab
- [ ] **0 or very few "RLS InitPlan" warnings** (should be eliminated)
- [ ] **0 or very few "Multiple Permissive Policies" warnings** (should be eliminated)
- [ ] **0 "Duplicate Index" warnings** (should be eliminated)

**If you still see warnings:**
1. Check which specific tables/policies are flagged
2. Review execution logs from Step 2 for any "Failed" messages
3. Re-run failed sections manually
4. Consult `POLICY_CONSOLIDATION_ANALYSIS.md` for edge cases

---

### Step 6: Run Smoke Tests (5 minutes)

**Test critical user flows:**

#### Authentication
- [ ] Sign up new user
- [ ] Log in existing user
- [ ] Update profile
- [ ] Log out

#### Core Features
- [ ] Create text post → Appears in feed immediately
- [ ] Create media post → Media uploads and displays
- [ ] Like a post → Count increments
- [ ] Comment on post → Comment appears
- [ ] Like a comment → Count increments
- [ ] Save a post → Shows in saved posts
- [ ] Follow a user → Request sent/accepted
- [ ] Receive notification → Bell icon shows unread count

#### Golf Features (if applicable)
- [ ] Create individual golf round → Stats display correctly
- [ ] Create shared golf round → Participants can view
- [ ] Edit golf scorecard → Changes save
- [ ] View profile media with stats → Tabs load

#### Performance Checks
- [ ] Feed loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Search returns results in < 1 second
- [ ] Profile page loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Post creation completes in < 1 second

**If any tests fail:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs: Dashboard → Logs
3. Review RLS policies for affected tables
4. Consult rollback procedures if needed

---

## Performance Testing

### Before/After Comparison

Run these queries before and after deployment to measure improvement:

```sql
-- Test 1: Profile query (should be 10-100x faster)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE profile_id IN (
  SELECT following_id FROM follows
  WHERE follower_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'accepted'
)
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Test 2: Notification query (should be 10x faster)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM notifications
WHERE recipient_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Test 3: Golf rounds query (should be much faster)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM golf_rounds
WHERE profile_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY played_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**What to look for:**
- **Before**: "Seq Scan", "InitPlan", high execution time (100ms-1s+)
- **After**: "Index Scan", cached subquery, low execution time (1-50ms)

### Load Testing (Optional but Recommended)

If you have time and resources:

1. Use tools like **k6** or **Artillery** to simulate concurrent users
2. Target: 100-1000 concurrent requests
3. Measure:
   - Average response time (should be < 100ms for simple queries)
   - P95 response time (should be < 500ms)
   - Error rate (should be 0%)
   - Database CPU usage (should be < 50% under load)

---

## Rollback Procedures

### If Something Goes Wrong

Each migration file includes rollback instructions in comments. Here's the quick reference:

#### Rollback Step 1 (Duplicate Indexes)

See `fix-duplicate-indexes-performance.sql` Section 4:

```sql
-- Restore all 5 indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_performances_date ON public.performances(date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_post ON public.post_comments(post_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_post_likes_post ON public.post_likes(post_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_post_media_post_display ON public.post_media(post_id, display_order);
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_tags ON public.posts USING btree(tags);
```

#### Rollback Step 2 (RLS Policies)

**Not recommended** - would require re-running your original RLS setup migrations. The optimized policies are functionally identical, just faster.

If you MUST rollback:
1. Identify which policies are causing issues
2. Re-run specific sections from your original setup migrations
3. Change `(select auth.uid())` back to `auth.uid()` (but this will hurt performance)

#### Rollback Step 4 (Auth Config)

Simple - just toggle settings back off in dashboard:
- Authentication → Providers → Password → Toggle leaked password protection OFF
- Authentication → MFA → Disable MFA options

## Monitoring After Deployment

### First 24 Hours

**Check every 2-4 hours:**

1. **Error Rates**: Dashboard → Logs → Filter by "error"
   - Should be zero or very low
   - Any RLS policy errors? Check policy syntax

2. **Performance Metrics**: Dashboard → Database → Performance Insights
   - Query times should be lower than before
   - Index usage should be higher
   - Cache hit rate should be high (>90%)

3. **User Reports**:
   - Monitor support channels
   - Any complaints about slow loading?
   - Any features broken?

### First Week

**Check daily:**

1. **Database Growth**: Dashboard → Database → Usage
   - Storage should grow linearly with users
