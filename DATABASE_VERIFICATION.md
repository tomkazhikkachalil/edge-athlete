# Database Connection Verification

## Overview
This document verifies that all likes and comments are properly stored in the database and that the UI accurately reflects the database state.

## Database Schema

### Posts Table
```sql
posts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  profile_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  caption TEXT,
  sport_key TEXT,
  visibility VARCHAR(20),
  likes_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,      -- Auto-updated by trigger
  comments_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,   -- Auto-updated by trigger
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  ...
)
```

### Post Likes Table
```sql
post_likes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  profile_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(post_id, profile_id)  -- Prevents duplicate likes
)
```

### Post Comments Table
```sql
post_comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  profile_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  parent_comment_id UUID,  -- For nested comments (future)
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

## Database Triggers (Automatic Count Updates)

### Likes Count Trigger
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_likes_count
  AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON post_likes
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_post_likes_count();
```
**Function Logic:**
- INSERT: Increments `posts.likes_count` by 1
- DELETE: Decrements `posts.likes_count` by 1

### Comments Count Trigger
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_comments_count
  AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON post_comments
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_post_comments_count();
```
**Function Logic:**
- INSERT: Increments `posts.comments_count` by 1
- DELETE: Decrements `posts.comments_count` by 1

## Data Flow

### When a User Likes a Post

1. **Client Request:**
   ```typescript
   POST /api/posts/like
   Body: { postId: "...", profileId: "..." }
   ```

2. **API Handler:** `/src/app/api/posts/like/route.ts`
   - Checks if like exists
   - If exists: DELETE from `post_likes`
   - If not: INSERT into `post_likes`
   - Database trigger automatically updates `posts.likes_count`
   - Queries database for updated count
   - Returns: `{ action: 'liked'|'unliked', likesCount: <actual_count> }`

3. **Database Actions:**
   ```sql
   -- If liking:
   INSERT INTO post_likes (post_id, profile_id) VALUES ($1, $2);
   -- Trigger runs:
   UPDATE posts SET likes_count = likes_count + 1 WHERE id = $1;

   -- If unliking:
   DELETE FROM post_likes WHERE post_id = $1 AND profile_id = $2;
   -- Trigger runs:
   UPDATE posts SET likes_count = likes_count - 1 WHERE id = $1;
   ```

4. **Client Update:**
   - Receives `likesCount` from server
   - Updates UI with actual database value

### When a User Comments on a Post

1. **Client Request:**
   ```typescript
   POST /api/comments
   Body: { postId: "...", content: "..." }
   ```

2. **API Handler:** `/src/app/api/comments/route.ts`
   - Authenticates user
   - Gets user's profile_id
   - INSERT into `post_comments`
   - Database trigger automatically updates `posts.comments_count`
   - Returns comment with profile data

3. **Database Actions:**
   ```sql
   -- Insert comment:
   INSERT INTO post_comments (post_id, profile_id, content)
   VALUES ($1, $2, $3)
   RETURNING *;

   -- Trigger runs automatically:
   UPDATE posts SET comments_count = comments_count + 1 WHERE id = $1;
   ```

4. **Client Update:**
   - Adds comment to local array
   - Updates comment count display
   - Notifies parent components

### When Fetching Posts

1. **Client Request:**
   ```typescript
   GET /api/posts?userId=<optional>&limit=20&offset=0
   ```

2. **API Handler:** `/src/app/api/posts/route.ts`
   ```typescript
   const { data: posts } = await supabase
     .from('posts')
     .select(`
       *,
       post_media(*),
       profiles(*),
       post_likes(profile_id)  // All likes for this post
     `)
     .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
   ```

3. **Database Query:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     posts.*,  -- Includes likes_count and comments_count
     post_media.*,
     profiles.*,
     post_likes.profile_id
   FROM posts
   LEFT JOIN post_media ON posts.id = post_media.post_id
   LEFT JOIN profiles ON posts.profile_id = profiles.id
   LEFT JOIN post_likes ON posts.id = post_likes.post_id
   ORDER BY posts.created_at DESC;
   ```

4. **Response:**
   ```typescript
   {
     posts: [
       {
         id: "...",
         likes_count: 5,        // From database
         comments_count: 3,     // From database
         likes: [               // All likes
           { profile_id: "user1" },
           { profile_id: "user2" },
           ...
         ],
         ...
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Verification Points

### ✅ Data Persistence
- **Likes:** Stored in `post_likes` table
- **Comments:** Stored in `post_comments` table
- **Counts:** Stored in `posts.likes_count` and `posts.comments_count`

### ✅ Database Constraints
- **Unique Likes:** `UNIQUE(post_id, profile_id)` prevents duplicate likes
- **Cascade Deletes:** Deleting a post removes all associated likes and comments
- **Required Fields:** Comments must have content, likes must have both IDs

### ✅ Automatic Count Updates
- **Triggers:** Run automatically on INSERT/DELETE
- **Atomic:** Count updates happen in the same transaction as the like/comment
- **Consistent:** Counts always match actual number of rows

### ✅ Row Level Security (RLS)
- **View Comments:** Users can see comments on posts they can view
- **Add Comments:** Users can only comment as themselves
- **Delete Comments:** Users can only delete their own comments
- **View Likes:** Users can see likes on posts they can view
- **Add/Remove Likes:** Users can only like/unlike as themselves

### ✅ API Validation
- **Authentication:** All write operations require authentication
- **Authorization:** Users can only create data with their own profile_id
- **Data Validation:** Required fields are checked before database operations

## Testing the Connection

To verify everything is working correctly:

### 1. Check if schema is applied
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM pg_tables
  WHERE tablename = 'post_likes'
) as likes_table_exists,
EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM pg_tables
  WHERE tablename = 'post_comments'
) as comments_table_exists;
```

### 2. Check if triggers exist
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT
  trigger_name,
  event_object_table,
  action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name IN ('update_likes_count', 'update_comments_count');
```

### 3. Test count accuracy
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.likes_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pl.id) as actual_likes,
  p.comments_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pc.id) as actual_comments
FROM posts p
LEFT JOIN post_likes pl ON p.id = pl.post_id
LEFT JOIN post_comments pc ON p.id = pc.post_id
GROUP BY p.id
HAVING
  p.likes_count != COUNT(DISTINCT pl.id) OR
  p.comments_count != COUNT(DISTINCT pc.id);
```
**Expected Result:** No rows (counts should match)

### 4. Check for duplicate likes
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT post_id, profile_id, COUNT(*)
FROM post_likes
GROUP BY post_id, profile_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
**Expected Result:** No rows (unique constraint prevents duplicates)

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Database Schema:** Applied via `update-posts-schema-safe.sql`
✅ **API Endpoints:** Implemented in `/src/app/api/`
✅ **Triggers:** Active and working
✅ **RLS Policies:** Enabled and enforced
✅ **UI Components:** Connected to database via API calls
