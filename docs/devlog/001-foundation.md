# Development Log #001: Foundation

**Date**: 2025-06-19  
**Phase**: Initial Setup  
**Focus**: Core Infrastructure

## Overview

This starter template provides a solid foundation for building AI-powered applications. Here's what we've set up for you to build upon.

## Tech Stack

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 15** - Latest App Router for modern React applications
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout your codebase with strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling with dark mode support
- **ESLint** - Code quality enforcement

### Backend Services
- **Supabase** - Complete backend platform
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Authentication (magic links)
  - File storage (5MB limit, images only)
  - Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Prisma ORM** - Type-safe database queries

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI API** - GPT-4.1-mini model
  - Text processing endpoint ready
  - Image analysis endpoint ready

### Communications
- **SendGrid** - Transactional emails
  - Welcome emails
  - Custom notifications

## Key Features Built In

### 1. Authentication System
- Magic link login (no passwords!)
- Whitelist approach - admin creates users
- Session management with cookies and auto-refresh
- Protected routes and API endpoints
- Rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes) to prevent abuse
- Proper error handling across all auth endpoints

### 2. User Management
- Admin panel at `/admin` with modern UI
- Create users with styled form component
- View users in responsive data table
- Delete users with confirmation
- Automatic welcome emails via SendGrid
- Component-based architecture for reusability

### 3. File System
- Secure file uploads
- User-specific storage
- Automatic file organization

### 4. Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Users can only see their own data
- Admin role for user management
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Session auto-refresh prevents unexpected logouts
- Comprehensive error handling without exposing internals

## Getting Started

### Your First Changes
1. Update the landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
2. Customize the dashboard (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
3. Add your own components in `src/components/`
4. Create new API routes in `src/app/api/`
5. Run `npm run lint` to check code quality
6. Test with `npm run build` before deploying

### Database Changes
1. Modify `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npm run db:migrate`
3. Update seed data if needed

### Adding Features
- Use existing auth patterns for protected routes
- Follow the API route structure
- Maintain RLS for security
- Use the AI endpoints as examples
- Organize components by feature (e.g., `/components/admin/`)
- Leverage built-in utilities like rate limiting

## Next Steps

This foundation gives you:
- ✅ Production-ready authentication with rate limiting
- ✅ Secure file storage with user isolation
- ✅ AI capabilities with GPT-4.1-mini
- ✅ Email communications via SendGrid
- ✅ Admin controls with modern UI components
- ✅ Code quality tools (ESLint, TypeScript strict mode)
- ✅ Component library started with admin components

The starter is production-ready - you can deploy this and have real users from day one. Now it's your turn to build something amazing on top!
