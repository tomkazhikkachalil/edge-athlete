# Development Log #003 - Weight System Fixes

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Developer**: Claude (AI Assistant)  
**Session Focus**: Weight system debugging and fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Weight Unit System Not Working
**Problem**: Weight values were being saved but not displaying correctly. Users reported that entering weight values in kg or stone units weren't reflecting properly on the athlete profile page.

**Root Cause**: Missing database column `weight_unit` caused API failures.

**Solution**:
- Added database migration to create `weight_unit` column:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS weight_unit TEXT DEFAULT 'lbs';
  ALTER TABLE profiles ALTER COLUMN weight_kg TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
  ```

### 2. Stone Unit Conversion Issues  
**Problem**: Stone unit (e.g., "11.7" for 11 stone 7 pounds) had conversion logic issues.

**Solution**: 
- Initially attempted to fix conversion logic, but user requested no conversions at all
- Reverted to simple display system: save exactly what user enters

### 3. Weight Values Not Saving from Edit Profile
**Problem**: Edit Profile form wasn't sending weight data to API, causing `weight_display: null` in database.

**Root Causes**:
- Missing `weight_display` database column
- Form validation issues with empty weight values
- Incorrect field inclusion in API payload

**Solutions**:
- Added `weight_display` column to database
- Updated TypeScript types to include `weight_display?: number`
- Fixed form logic to always include weight fields in API calls
- Improved error handling for weight validation

### 4. Data Inconsistency Between Pages
**Problem**: Changes made in Edit Profile modal weren't reflecting on the athlete profile page.

**Root Cause**: Profile refresh system was working, but weight display logic was using old conversion system.

**Solution**:
- Updated athlete profile page to prioritize `weight_display` field
- Added fallback to old `weight_kg` system for backward compatibility
- Enhanced profile refresh to reload all athlete data after save

## Technical Changes

### Database Schema
```sql
-- New columns added
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS weight_unit TEXT DEFAULT 'lbs';
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS weight_display DECIMAL(5,2);
ALTER TABLE profiles ALTER COLUMN weight_kg TYPE DECIMAL(5,2);
```

### Code Changes
- **EditProfileTabs.tsx**: Removed weight conversion functions, added direct save logic
- **athlete/page.tsx**: Updated weight display to show `weight_display + weight_unit` format
- **supabase.ts**: Added `weight_display` field to Profile interface
- **profile API**: Enhanced to handle new weight_display field

### UI Improvements
- **Global CSS**: Added rule to make all input field text black for better visibility
- **Form validation**: Improved weight field validation and error handling
- **Console logging**: Added debugging logs to track weight save process

## User Experience Improvements

### Weight System Behavior
**Before**: Complex conversion system that didn't preserve user input  
**After**: Simple system that saves and displays exactly what user enters

**Examples**:
- Enter "150" with "lbs" → Displays "150 lbs"  
- Enter "70" with "kg" → Displays "70 kg"
- Enter "11.7" with "stone" → Displays "11.7 stone"

### Input Field Styling
- All input fields now have black text for better readability
- Applied globally via CSS rule targeting `input`, `textarea`, `select`

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Weight saving in all three units (lbs, kg, stone)
- ✅ Profile edit modal functionality
- ✅ Data consistency between edit form and profile display
- ✅ Profile refresh after save
- ✅ Logout functionality  
- ✅ Build and lint checks

## Maintenance Tasks Completed
- ✅ ESLint fixes (removed unused imports)
- ✅ TypeScript error resolution
- ✅ Production build verification
- ✅ Code cleanup and optimization

## Notes for Future Development
- Weight system now uses `weight_display` + `weight_unit` pattern
- Old `weight_kg` field maintained for backward compatibility
- Consider deprecating conversion system entirely in future versions
- All new weight-related features should use the direct save/display approach

## Database Migration Required
Users must run this SQL in Supabase dashboard:
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS weight_display DECIMAL(5,2);
```

**Status**: ✅ Feature Complete and Tested
