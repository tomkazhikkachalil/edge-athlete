### 🎨 UI Components
- **CreatePostModal**: Main modal with 4-step flow
- **CreatePostModalSteps**: Step-by-step content (type, media, stats, caption)
- **Sport selection**: Golf enabled, others show "Coming Soon"
- **Media upload**: Drag & drop with preview, reordering, deletion
- **Golf stats form**: Course, score, par, FIR%, GIR%, putts, date, notes
