- ✅ `/database-verification-complete.sql` - Comprehensive verification script
- ✅ `/SUPABASE_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide

### Testing & Validation

- ✅ `/docs/qa-test-guide.md` - Manual testing guide

## 🗄️ Database Schema Overview

### Tables to be Created/Extended

#### 1. Extended Profiles Table
**New columns added to existing `profiles` table:**
```sql
display_name TEXT,
sport TEXT, 
school TEXT,
location TEXT,
coach TEXT,
bio TEXT,
graduation_year INTEGER,
gpa NUMERIC(3,2),
sat_score INTEGER,
act_score INTEGER,
avatar_url TEXT
```

#### 2. New Athlete Tables
- **`athlete_badges`** - Achievement badges with display order
- **`athlete_vitals`** - Physical measurements and performance stats  
- **`athlete_socials`** - Social media handles
- **`athlete_performances`** - Competition results and times
- **`athlete_season_highlights`** - Featured stats for display

### Security Configuration
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ✅ User isolation - users can only access their own data
- ✅ Storage policies for avatar uploads
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Schema
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire content of `/supabase-athlete-schema.sql`
3. Execute the script

### Step 2: Verify Setup
1. Run the verification script: `/database-verification-complete.sql`
2. Check for all ✅ status indicators

### Step 3: Test Data Operations
```bash
# Run automated tests (requires .env.local setup)
node scripts/test-supabase-data.mjs
```

### Step 4: Test UI
1. Start app: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/athlete`
3. Test profile editing and data persistence

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security Policies
```sql
-- Users can only access their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users manage own data" ON athlete_badges
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);

-- Similar policies on all athlete_* tables
```

### Storage Security
```sql
-- Users upload to their own folder
-- Path structure: uploads/{user_id}/filename.ext
-- Public read access for avatars
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Database Tests ✅
- [ ] All tables created successfully
- [ ] RLS policies are active
- [ ] Storage bucket configured
- [ ] Data insertion works
- [ ] Data retrieval works
- [ ] Cross-user access blocked

### Application Tests ✅  
- [ ] Athlete page loads without errors
- [ ] Profile editing saves data
- [ ] Avatar upload functional
- [ ] Performance CRUD operations work
- [ ] Season highlights display correctly

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Add to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## 📊 Expected Data Flow

```
1. User Authentication (Supabase Auth)
   ↓
2. Profile Creation (profiles table extended)
   ↓  
3. Athlete Data Entry (athlete_* tables)
   ↓
4. File Uploads (Supabase Storage)
   ↓
5. Data Display (Athlete Profile Page)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Relationships
- All athlete tables use `user_id` (TEXT) linking to `auth.uid()`
- No foreign key constraints to profiles table (by design)
- RLS policies enforce data isolation

### File Storage  
- Bucket: `uploads` (public read access)
- User folders: `uploads/{user_id}/`
- Supported: Images up to 5MB
- Auto-generated unique filenames

### Performance
- Indexes on user_id and display_order fields
- Optimized queries in athlete service
- Lazy loading for large datasets

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Schema creation fails:**
- Verify you have admin access to Supabase project
- Check for existing tables with different structures
- Run verification script to identify issues

**RLS blocks data access:**
- Ensure user is properly authenticated
- Check `auth.uid()` returns correct user ID
- Verify RLS policies are correctly applied

**Storage upload fails:**
- Confirm bucket exists and is public
- Check storage policies allow user uploads
- Verify file size and type restrictions

**Environment variables missing:**
- Copy all required variables from Supabase dashboard
- Use service role key for server-side operations
- Test connection with verification script

## 📈 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components
- Database schema design
- RLS security policies
- Storage configuration
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Frontend athlete page
- Edit modals with all tabs
- Avatar upload functionality
