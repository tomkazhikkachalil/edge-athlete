## üìã Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard
# Copy content of implement-notifications-system.sql
# Paste into SQL Editor and run

# Option B: Via psql (if you have DATABASE_URL)
psql $DATABASE_URL -f implement-notifications-system.sql
```

### 2. Verify Database Setup
Run these queries to confirm:
```sql
-- Check tables created
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('notifications', 'connection_suggestions');

-- Check triggers
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE 'trigger_notify%';

-- Check RLS enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('notifications', 'connection_suggestions');
```

### 3. Test the System

#### Test Follow Request with Message
1. Create two user accounts (User A, User B)
2. Set User B's profile to private (`visibility = 'private'`)
3. User A clicks Follow on User B
4. User A enters message: "Hi! I'd love to connect"
5. **Expected**: User B receives notification with message
6. User B navigates to `/app/followers?tab=requests`
7. User B sees request with message
8. User B accepts request
9. **Expected**: User A receives "follow accepted" notification

#### Test Notifications
1. User A likes User B's post
   - **Expected**: User B receives like notification
2. User A comments on User B's post
   - **Expected**: User B receives comment notification
3. Click notification
   - **Expected**: Navigate to relevant page (post, profile, etc.)
4. Click "Mark all as read"
   - **Expected**: All notifications marked as read, badge disappears

#### Test Connection Suggestions
1. Create users with same sport/school
2. Navigate to `/feed`
3. **Expected**: Sidebar shows suggested connections
4. Click follow on suggestion
   - **Expected**: Follow request sent, suggestion removed
5. Click dismiss on suggestion
   - **Expected**: Suggestion hidden

### 4. UI/UX Verification

#### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Notifications dropdown appears on bell icon click
- [ ] Unread badge shows correct count
- [ ] Clicking notification navigates correctly
- [ ] Follow message modal appears when following
- [ ] Suggestions sidebar displays correctly
- [ ] Followers page tabs work (Followers/Following/Requests)

#### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Notifications dropdown is touch-friendly
- [ ] Follow message modal is full-screen on mobile
- [ ] Followers page stacks correctly on mobile
- [ ] Suggestions compact on mobile screens
- [ ] All buttons are tap-friendly (44px min)

### 5. Performance Testing
- [ ] Notification polling doesn't cause lag (30s interval)
- [ ] Large notification lists paginate correctly
- [ ] Suggestions load quickly (<500ms)
- [ ] Follow actions are instant with optimistic UI

## üîß Configuration Options

### Customization Points

**Notification Polling Interval** (NotificationsDropdown.tsx:37)
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(loadNotifications, 30000); // 30 seconds
```

**Suggestion Limit** (Feed page)
```typescript
<ConnectionSuggestions profileId={user.id} limit={5} compact={true} />
```

**Suggestion Algorithm** (implement-notifications-system.sql:210)
```sql
-- Adjust scoring in generate_connection_suggestions function
CASE WHEN p.sport = (SELECT sport FROM user_profile) THEN 0.4 ELSE 0.0 END +
CASE WHEN p.school = (SELECT school FROM user_profile) THEN 0.3 ELSE 0.0 END +
...
```

**Follow Message Length** (FollowButton.tsx:200)
```typescript
maxLength={200} // Change character limit
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Notifications not appearing
**Solution**:
1. Check triggers are active
2. Verify RLS policies
3. Check notification records in database

### Issue: Suggestions empty
**Solution**:
1. Ensure profiles have sport/school data
2. Test function directly: `SELECT * FROM generate_connection_suggestions('user-id', 10)`
3. Check for existing follows (won't suggest already following)

### Issue: Follow message not saved
**Solution**:
1. Verify `follows` table has `message` column
2. Check API payload includes message
3. Verify database trigger processes message

## üìä Metrics to Monitor

Post-deployment monitoring:
- Notification delivery rate (triggers firing correctly)
- Follow request acceptance rate
- Suggestion click-through rate
- Average notifications per user per day
- Peak notification times

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Consider for v2:
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket notifications (instant delivery)
- [ ] Email notifications for important events
- [ ] Push notifications (mobile PWA)
- [ ] Notification preferences per type
- [ ] Advanced suggestions (mutual connections, AI-based)
- [ ] Notification grouping ("5 people liked your post")
- [ ] Read receipts for follow messages
- [ ] Scheduled follow request reminders
