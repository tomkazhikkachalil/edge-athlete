# Golf Round Conditions & Course Difficulty Fields - Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to add weather conditions, temperature, wind, and course difficulty fields to golf rounds in the database.

## Current Status

### ‚ùå Fields NOT in Database (Yet)
The following fields are **currently missing** from the `golf_rounds` table:
- `weather` (TEXT) - Weather conditions during the round
- `temperature` (INTEGER) - Temperature in Fahrenheit
- `wind` (TEXT) - Wind conditions during the round
- `course_rating` (DECIMAL) - USGA Course Rating
- `slope_rating` (INTEGER) - USGA Slope Rating

### ‚úÖ Fields Already Captured in UI
The **GolfScorecardForm** component (`src/components/GolfScorecardForm.tsx`) already has input fields for:
- Weather
- Temperature
- Wind
- Course Rating
- Course Slope

However, these fields are **not being saved** to the database because the columns don't exist yet.

### ‚úÖ Display Already Implemented
The **PostCard** component (`src/components/PostCard.tsx`) already has code to display these fields when available (lines 552-586).

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

**Location:** `add-golf-round-conditions.sql`

**Instructions:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the entire contents of `add-golf-round-conditions.sql`
6. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

**What it does:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE golf_rounds ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS weather TEXT;
ALTER TABLE golf_rounds ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS temperature INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE golf_rounds ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS wind TEXT;
ALTER TABLE golf_rounds ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS course_rating DECIMAL(4,1);
ALTER TABLE golf_rounds ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS slope_rating INTEGER;
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration

After running the migration, verify the columns were added:

```sql
SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'golf_rounds'
  AND column_name IN ('weather', 'temperature', 'wind', 'course_rating', 'slope_rating')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

**Expected output:**
| column_name    | data_type        | is_nullable |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| course_rating  | numeric          | YES         |
| slope_rating   | integer          | YES         |
| temperature    | integer          | YES         |
| weather        | text             | YES         |
| wind           | text             | YES         |

### Step 3: Update Golf Round Creation Code

Ensure the golf round creation API saves these fields. Check:

**File:** `src/app/api/golf/route.ts` (or wherever golf rounds are created)

The API should accept and save these fields:
```typescript
const roundData = {
  // ... existing fields
  weather: data.weather,
  temperature: data.temperature,
  wind: data.wind,
  course_rating: data.courseRating,
  slope_rating: data.courseSlope,
};
```

## Field Specifications

### Weather (TEXT)
- **Description:** General weather conditions during the round
- **Examples:** "Sunny", "Cloudy", "Rainy", "Partly Cloudy", "Overcast"
- **Display:** Shows with cloud-sun icon (‚òÅÔ∏è)
- **Optional:** Yes

### Temperature (INTEGER)
- **Description:** Temperature in Fahrenheit during the round
- **Range:** Typically 0-120¬∞F
- **Examples:** 72, 85, 45
- **Display:** Shows with thermometer icon (üå°Ô∏è) and "¬∞F" suffix
- **Optional:** Yes

### Wind (TEXT)
- **Description:** Wind conditions during the round
- **Examples:** "Calm", "Light Breeze", "Windy", "Strong Winds", "Gusts"
- **Display:** Shows with wind icon (üí®)
- **Optional:** Yes

### Course Rating (DECIMAL 4,1)
- **Description:** USGA Course Rating (difficulty for a scratch golfer)
- **Range:** Typically 65.0-80.0
- **Format:** One decimal place (e.g., 75.5, 72.3)
- **Examples:** 75.5, 72.0, 78.1
- **Display:** Shows as "Rating: 75.5"
- **Optional:** Yes

### Slope Rating (INTEGER)
- **Description:** USGA Slope Rating (relative difficulty, 113 is average)
- **Range:** 55-155 (per USGA standards)
- **Examples:** 113, 145, 128
- **Display:** Shows as "Slope: 145"
- **Optional:** Yes

## How It Displays in Posts

Once the migration is complete and data is saved, the fields will display in golf round posts like this:

```
[Golf Ball Icon] Pebble Beach Golf Links
Oct 15 ‚Ä¢ White Tees ‚Ä¢ 18 Holes

[Score Badge: 85 (+13)]

Putts: 32  FIR: 64%  GIR: 56%

‚òÅÔ∏è Sunny  üå°Ô∏è 72¬∞F  üí® Light Breeze  Rating: 75.5  Slope: 145

[View Scorecard (18 holes)]
```

**Display Logic:**
- Only shows the second row (weather/conditions) if at least ONE field has data
- Each field displays independently (won't show blank spaces for missing data)
- Wraps to multiple lines on smaller screens
- Uses icons for weather, temperature, and wind
- Uses text labels for rating and slope

## UI Components Updated

### ‚úÖ PostCard.tsx (Lines 552-586)
**Status:** Already updated to display these fields

**Features:**
- Conditional rendering (only shows if data exists)
- Icon-based display for weather, temperature, wind
- Text-based display for course rating and slope
- Responsive flex-wrap layout
- Consistent styling with existing stats bar

### ‚úÖ GolfScorecardForm.tsx
**Status:** Already has input fields for all these values

**Features:**
- Weather dropdown/input
- Temperature number input
- Wind dropdown/input
- Course rating from course database or manual input
- Course slope from course database or manual input

## Testing Checklist

After running the migration:

1. ‚úÖ Create a new golf round with weather data
2. ‚úÖ Verify data saves to database
3. ‚úÖ View the post and confirm fields display correctly
4. ‚úÖ Test with partial data (only some fields filled)
5. ‚úÖ Test with no weather data (should not show the section)
6. ‚úÖ Test on mobile/tablet for responsive layout

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
- **Error:** "column already exists"
  - **Solution:** This is safe! The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause prevents errors. The column is already there.

### Fields Not Saving
- **Check:** Is the API route updated to accept these fields?
- **Check:** Is the form data being passed correctly?
- **Check:** Check browser console for any errors during save

### Fields Not Displaying
- **Check:** Did the migration run successfully?
- **Check:** Does the post have data in these fields?
- **Check:** Check browser console for any TypeScript errors

## Benefits

Once implemented, athletes will be able to:
- **Document playing conditions** for more context around their scores
- **Track performance** under different weather conditions
- **Show course difficulty** with official USGA ratings
- **Build more complete** round records for analysis
- **Share richer stories** about their golf experiences

## Related Files

- **Migration:** `add-golf-round-conditions.sql`

- **Type Definitions:** `src/lib/supabase.ts` (could add GolfRound interface)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run the migration SQL in Supabase
2. ‚è≥ Update the golf round creation API to save these fields
