# Database Migrations — canonical guide

## The one source of truth

**`database/migrations/`** holds the numbered migrations, `001` … `030`. They are
the canonical schema history and are applied **in order** via the Supabase SQL
editor (this project does not use the Supabase CLI migration runner).

There is **no automated migration tracking** — which migrations have been applied
is tracked here and in `DEVLOG.md`. Each recent migration's DEVLOG entry records
when it was run and its live-verification result.

## Applied migrations (as of migration 030)

`001`–`030` have all been run in production and verified. Notable recent ones:

| # | What |
|---|---|
| 020 | Schema cleanup — `activity_mode` replaces `golf_mode` |
| 022 | `get_profile_media_counts` fix after 020 |
| 023 | Drop `posts.golf_mode` |
| 024 | `get_unread_message_count` RPC (was never defined) |
| 025 | Fix `notify_profile_tagged` (tagging was broken in prod) |
| 026 | Unread count floored at `joined_at` |
| 027 | `waitlist` table |
| 028 | Notification types: `group_invite`, `group_update` |
| 029 | `profiles.onboarded_at` (onboarding gate) |
| 030 | `notification_preferences.last_digest_at` (email digest) |

## Workflow for a new migration

1. Add `NNN_short_name.sql` to `database/migrations/` with a header block:
   what/why, a **pre-flight** query section, and an **order-of-operations** note
   if code must ship before or after it.
2. Run it in the Supabase SQL editor.
3. Verify against the live DB (the established pattern: query via PostgREST with
   the service-role key; for DDL that drops columns, scan `pg_proc` for function
   bodies referencing the dropped object — Postgres does **not** block
   `DROP COLUMN` on function bodies, they break at runtime; see migration 022's
   lesson).
4. Record it in `DEVLOG.md`.

## ⚠️ Everything else is historical — do NOT run it

These directories are **reference only**. Running any script in them against a
live database is how prod breakage happens (an archived trigger script already
broke tagging once — see migration 025):

- `database/archive/` — superseded migrations and hot-fix scripts
- `database/archive/loose-legacy/` — stray SQL consolidated here from old
  `database-migrations/`, `supabase/migrations/`, and the repo root
- `database/features/` — feature-development SQL, folded into the numbered
  migrations
- `database/fixes/` — one-off fix scripts, folded into the numbered migrations

If you need something from these, port it into a new numbered migration rather
than running the file directly.
