## Overview

A comprehensive, real-time notification system has been implemented for the Edge Athlete platform. This guide will walk you through setting up and using the system.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Features
- **Real-time notifications** via Supabase subscriptions
- **Notification bell** with unread count badge in header
- **Full notification center** with filtering, grouping, and actions
- **11 notification types**: follow requests, likes, comments, mentions, achievements, etc.
- **User preferences** for granular notification control
- **Automatic triggers** for all major user actions
- **Mark as read/unread** functionality
- **Delete individual** or clear all notifications
- **Desktop browser notifications** (with permission)
- **Time-based grouping** (Today, Yesterday, This Week, Earlier)
- **Pagination** with cursor-based infinite scroll

### ✅ Notification Types

1. **Follow Request** - When someone sends a follow request (private profiles)
2. **Follow Accepted** - When your follow request is accepted
3. **New Follower** - When someone follows you (public profiles)
4. **Like** - When someone likes your post
5. **Comment** - When someone comments on your post
6. **Comment Reply** - When someone replies to your comment (future)
7. **Mention** - When someone mentions you (future)
8. **Tag** - When someone tags you in media (future)
9. **Achievement** - When you unlock a badge/milestone (future)
10. **System Announcement** - Platform-wide updates (future)
11. **Club/Team Update** - Organization notifications (future)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Setup

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `setup-notifications-schema.sql`
4. Paste into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**

This will create:
- `notifications` table with proper indexes
- `notification_preferences` table
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Automatic triggers for follow requests, likes, comments
- Helper functions for creating notifications

**Verify Setup:**
```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT * FROM notifications LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM notification_preferences LIMIT 1;

-- Check triggers exist
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE '%notify%';

-- Expected triggers:
-- trigger_notify_follow_request
-- trigger_notify_follow_accepted
-- trigger_notify_new_follower
-- trigger_notify_post_like
-- trigger_notify_post_comment
```

### Step 2: Enable Supabase Realtime (CRITICAL)

The notification system uses Supabase Realtime for instant updates. You MUST enable it:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Database** → **Replication**
3. Find the `notifications` table
4. Click the toggle to **enable replication** for this table
5. Click **Save**

**Without this step, real-time notifications will NOT work!**

### Step 3: Verify Application Files

All necessary files have been created. Verify they exist:

**Backend API:**
- ✅ `/src/app/api/notifications/route.ts` - Main notifications endpoint
- ✅ `/src/app/api/notifications/unread-count/route.ts` - Unread count
- ✅ `/src/app/api/notifications/[id]/route.ts` - Update/delete single notification
- ✅ `/src/app/api/notifications/mark-all-read/route.ts` - Mark all as read
- ✅ `/src/app/api/notifications/preferences/route.ts` - User preferences

**Frontend:**
- ✅ `/src/lib/notifications.tsx` - Context provider with real-time subscriptions
- ✅ `/src/components/NotificationBell.tsx` - Bell icon with dropdown
- ✅ `/src/app/notifications/page.tsx` - Full notification center
- ✅ `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Updated with NotificationsProvider
- ✅ `/src/app/feed/page.tsx` - Updated with NotificationBell

### Step 4: Test the System

**Test 1: Follow Request Notification**

1. Create two test accounts (User A and User B)
2. Make User B's profile private:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles SET visibility = 'private' WHERE id = 'user-b-id';
   ```
3. **User A**: Send follow request to User B
4. **User B**: Should see notification bell badge update (count: 1)
5. **User B**: Click bell → see "User A sent you a follow request"
6. **User B**: Navigate to `/notifications` → see full notification center
7. **User B**: Accept the request from notifications page
8. **User A**: Should receive "Follow Accepted" notification in real-time

**Test 2: Like Notification**

1. **User A**: Create a post
2. **User B**: Like the post
3. **User A**: Should instantly see notification bell badge update
4. **User A**: Click bell → see "User B liked your post"
5. **User A**: Click notification → navigate to post

**Test 3: Comment Notification**

1. **User A**: Create a post
2. **User B**: Comment on the post
3. **User A**: Should instantly see notification
4. **User A**: Click notification → see comment with preview text

**Test 4: Real-time Updates**

1. Open two browser windows (User A and User B)
2. User B likes User A's post
3. User A's notification bell should update **immediately** without page refresh
4. Verify desktop notification appears (if permission granted)

**Test 5: Notification Center Features**

1. Navigate to `/notifications`
2. Verify tabs work: All, Unread, Follows, Engagement, System
3. Test "Mark all read" button
4. Test individual notification delete button
5. Test "Clear all" with confirmation modal
6. Scroll down → test "Load more" pagination
7. Verify time grouping (Today, Yesterday, This Week, Earlier)

### Step 5: Verify Real-time Subscription

Check browser console for real-time logs:

```
[NOTIFICATIONS] Setting up real-time subscription for user: <user-id>
[NOTIFICATIONS] New notification received: { ... }
```

If you don't see these logs, check:
1. Supabase Realtime is enabled for `notifications` table
2. Environment variables are correct
3. User is authenticated

## Usage in Code

### Access Notifications Hook

```typescript
import { useNotifications } from '@/lib/notifications';

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    notifications,      // Array of notifications
    unreadCount,        // Number of unread
    loading,            // Loading state
    error,              // Error state
    hasMore,            // Has more to load
    fetchNotifications, // Fetch more
    markAsRead,         // Mark one as read
    markAllAsRead,      // Mark all as read
    deleteNotification, // Delete one
    clearAll,           // Delete all
    refreshUnreadCount  // Refresh count
  } = useNotifications();

  // Use the data...
}
```

### Create Manual Notification

Use the SQL function directly from Supabase:

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('create_notification', {
  p_user_id: 'recipient-user-id',
  p_type: 'system_announcement',
  p_actor_id: null, // Can be null for system notifications
  p_title: 'New Feature Released!',
  p_message: 'Check out our new golf scorecard feature',
  p_action_url: '/features/golf',
  p_metadata: { feature_id: 'golf-scorecard' }
});
```

### Create Notification from API Route

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);

// Create notification
await supabaseAdmin.rpc('create_notification', {
  p_user_id: userId,
  p_type: 'achievement',
  p_actor_id: null,
  p_title: 'Achievement Unlocked: First Post!',
  p_message: 'You created your first post!',
  p_action_url: '/profile?tab=achievements',
  p_metadata: { achievement_id: 'first-post' }
});
```

## Notification Preferences

Users can customize which notifications they receive:

1. Navigate to `/notifications`
2. Click settings/preferences icon (future)
3. Toggle notification types on/off
4. Changes are saved automatically

**Preference Types:**
- Follow requests
- Follow accepted
- New followers
- Likes
- Comments
- Mentions
- Tags
- Achievements
- System announcements
- Club/team updates

## Automatic Triggers

The system automatically creates notifications for these events:

### 1. Follow Request (Pending)
**Trigger**: When someone sends a follow request to a private profile
**Recipient**: The user being followed
**Action**: View in `/app/followers?tab=requests`

### 2. Follow Accepted
**Trigger**: When a follow request status changes from 'pending' to 'accepted'
**Recipient**: The user who sent the request
**Action**: View profile of person who accepted

### 3. New Follower (Instant)
**Trigger**: When someone follows a public profile (instant follow, no request)
**Recipient**: The user being followed
**Action**: View follower's profile

### 4. Post Like
**Trigger**: When someone likes a post
**Recipient**: Post author (unless they liked their own post)
**Action**: View the post

### 5. Post Comment
**Trigger**: When someone comments on a post
**Recipient**: Post author (unless they commented on their own post)
**Action**: View post with comment highlighted

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Notifications not appearing in real-time

**Possible causes:**
1. Supabase Realtime not enabled for `notifications` table
2. Real-time subscription failed to connect
3. Browser console shows errors

**Solutions:**
1. Enable realtime replication in Supabase dashboard
2. Check browser console for `[NOTIFICATIONS]` logs
3. Verify Supabase connection is working
4. Try refreshing the page

### Issue: Notification bell badge not updating

**Possible causes:**
1. Context provider not wrapping the app
2. Component not using `useNotifications` hook
3. Real-time subscription issue

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `NotificationsProvider` is in `layout.tsx`
2. Check `NotificationBell` is imported correctly
3. Check console for errors

### Issue: Notifications not created when actions occur

**Possible causes:**
1. Database triggers not created
2. User has disabled this notification type
3. User is triggering action on their own content

**Solutions:**
1. Run `setup-notifications-schema.sql` again
2. Check `notification_preferences` table
3. Verify action is by a different user (you can't notify yourself)

### Issue: "table does not exist" error

**Cause**: Database schema not set up

**Solution**:
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `setup-notifications-schema.sql`
3. Verify tables exist

### Issue: Desktop notifications not showing

**Possible causes:**
1. Browser notification permission not granted
2. Browser doesn't support Notification API
3. Permission was denied

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser settings → Notifications
2. Allow notifications for your domain
3. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes

The system includes optimized indexes:
- `idx_notifications_user_id` - Fast user lookup
- `idx_notifications_user_unread` - Fast unread count
- `idx_notifications_created_at` - Fast pagination
- `idx_notifications_type` - Fast type filtering

### Pagination

Uses cursor-based pagination (created_at timestamp) for better performance than offset-based pagination.

### Real-time Subscriptions

Only subscribes to notifications for the current user (filtered by `user_id`). This prevents unnecessary data transfer.

### Cleanup

Old read notifications are automatically cleaned up after 90 days:

```sql
SELECT cleanup_old_notifications();
```

**Set up automatic cleanup (optional):**

Create a cron job in Supabase:
1. Go to Database → Functions
2. Create a new function scheduled to run daily
3. Execute `cleanup_old_notifications()`
