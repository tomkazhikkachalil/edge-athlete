## Foreign Key Integrity ✅

### Cascade Delete Behavior

All critical relationships use **ON DELETE CASCADE**, ensuring no orphaned records:

| Parent Table | Child Table | Cascade | Status |
|--------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| profiles | posts | ✅ | Deleting profile deletes all posts |
| profiles | golf_rounds | ✅ | Deleting profile deletes all rounds |
| profiles | follows (both FK) | ✅ | Deleting profile removes all follow relationships |
| profiles | post_likes | ✅ | Deleting profile removes all likes |
| profiles | post_comments | ✅ | Deleting profile removes all comments |
| profiles | notifications (both FK) | ✅ | Deleting profile removes all notifications |
| profiles | sport_settings | ✅ | Deleting profile removes all sport settings |
| posts | post_media | ✅ | Deleting post deletes all media |
| posts | post_likes | ✅ | Deleting post removes all likes |
| posts | post_comments | ✅ | Deleting post removes all comments |
| posts | post_tags | ✅ | Deleting post removes all tags |
| golf_rounds | golf_holes | ✅ | Deleting round deletes all holes |
| post_comments | comment_likes | ✅ | Deleting comment removes all likes |
| post_comments | post_comments (parent) | ✅ | Deleting comment removes threaded replies |

**Verdict:** ✅ All foreign keys properly configured with cascade delete

| post_media | ✅ | Inherits from posts | ✅ Correct |
| golf_rounds | ✅ | Owner only | ✅ Correct |
| golf_holes | ✅ | Owner only | ✅ Correct |

## Potential Issues & Recommendations

### ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

#### 1. **Profile Signup Trigger Disabled**
- **Issue:** The `on_auth_user_created` trigger was causing signup failures
- **Current Solution:** Trigger disabled, API handles profile creation via UPSERT
- **Status:** ✅ Working, but could be re-enabled with better error handling
- **Recommendation:** Keep current approach (API-driven) as it provides better error messages

#### 2. **Middle Name Display**
- **Issue:** Middle names are queried from database but not displayed in UI (by design as of Oct 2025)
- **Current Solution:** `formatDisplayName()` uses null for middle name parameter
- **Status:** ✅ Correct implementation, documented in CLAUDE.md
- **Recommendation:** No action needed, working as intended

#### 3. **Sport-Specific Settings Not in Profiles Table**
- **Issue:** Golf handicap, home course, etc. not in profiles table
- **Current Solution:** Separate sport_settings table with JSONB storage
- **Status:** ✅ Better design, more scalable
- **Recommendation:** No action needed, architecture is superior

### ✅ No Critical Issues Found

All critical data flows are properly wired:
- Profile creation → auth.users + profiles
- Post creation → posts + post_media + golf_rounds + golf_holes
- Follows → follows with correct directional relationship
- Likes → post_likes with correct associations
- Comments → post_comments with threading support
- Notifications → notifications with recipient and actor
- Privacy → RLS policies enforce access control

## Quick Health Check Query

Run this query to get a fast overview of any profile's data:

```sql
-- Replace with your test profile ID
\set profile_id 'YOUR_PROFILE_ID_HERE'

SELECT
  '🎯 PROFILE HEALTH CHECK' as title,

  -- Core data
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles WHERE id = :'profile_id') as profile_exists,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sport_settings WHERE profile_id = :'profile_id') as sport_settings_count,

  -- Content
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE profile_id = :'profile_id') as posts_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM post_media pm JOIN posts p ON p.id = pm.post_id WHERE p.profile_id = :'profile_id') as media_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM golf_rounds WHERE profile_id = :'profile_id') as golf_rounds_count,

  -- Social
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM follows WHERE following_id = :'profile_id' AND status = 'accepted') as followers_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM follows WHERE follower_id = :'profile_id' AND status = 'accepted') as following_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM follows WHERE following_id = :'profile_id' AND status = 'pending') as pending_requests,

  -- Engagement
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM post_likes pl JOIN posts p ON p.id = pl.post_id WHERE p.profile_id = :'profile_id') as likes_received,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM post_comments c JOIN posts p ON p.id = c.post_id WHERE p.profile_id = :'profile_id' AND c.profile_id != :'profile_id') as comments_received,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM saved_posts WHERE profile_id = :'profile_id') as saved_posts_count,

  -- Notifications
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications WHERE recipient_id = :'profile_id') as total_notifications,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications WHERE recipient_id = :'profile_id' AND NOT is_read) as unread_notifications,

  -- Integrity checks
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts p LEFT JOIN profiles pr ON pr.id = p.profile_id WHERE p.profile_id = :'profile_id' AND pr.id IS NULL) as orphaned_posts,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM post_media pm LEFT JOIN posts p ON p.id = pm.post_id JOIN posts p2 ON p2.id = pm.post_id WHERE p2.profile_id = :'profile_id' AND p.id IS NULL) as orphaned_media;
```

**Expected for new profile:**
- profile_exists: 1
- All counts ≥ 0 (depends on actions taken)
- orphaned_posts: 0
- orphaned_media: 0
