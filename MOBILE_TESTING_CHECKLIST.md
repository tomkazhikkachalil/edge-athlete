## üöÄ Next Steps After Mobile Testing

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Test on a real iPhone/iPad** if possible - simulators don't catch everything
- **Test in Safari** (not just Chrome) - iOS uses Safari engine
- **Test with actual golfers** - they'll find issues you missed
- **Focus on the scorecard** - that's your differentiator, it MUST work perfectly
- **Don't rush** - mobile issues kill user retention

---

**Start with the golf scorecard form** - that's the most critical flow for your MVP!
