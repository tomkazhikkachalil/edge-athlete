## 🚀 How to Activate (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor, then run this file:
```
implement-privacy-system.sql
```

**What it does:**
- Adds `visibility` column to profiles (public/private)
- Updates security policies (RLS) to enforce privacy
- Creates helper functions
- Adds indexes for performance

**Time**: ~30 seconds

---

### Step 2: Test the Privacy Toggle

1. Open your app
2. Go to **Edit Profile** → **Basic Info** tab
3. Scroll down - you'll see a new **"Profile Visibility"** section
4. Toggle between Public and Private
5. Save changes

**The toggle looks like this:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Profile Visibility              [⚫️━━━] │
│ Anyone can view your profile...         │
│                                         │
│          🟢 Public Profile              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 3: Test Privacy Enforcement

Account 1 (You):
1. Set your profile to **Private**
2. Log out

Account 2 (Friend):
1. Log in
2. Search for Account 1
3. Click their profile
4. You'll see: "This Profile is Private" with limited info
5. Click **Follow** button

7. After acceptance, Account 2 can see full profile

## 🔒 How Privacy Works

### Public Profile (Default)
```
Public Profile → Anyone Logged In → Full Access
                                     - View posts
                                     - View stats
                                     - View golf rounds
                                     - View achievements
```

### Private Profile
```
Private Profile → Owner → Full Access
                ↓
                → Followers (Accepted) → Full Access
                ↓
                → Non-Followers → Limited Access
                                  - Name
                                  - Avatar
                                  - Sport
                                  - School
                                  - Follow button
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After running the SQL migration:

### Database
- [ ] Open Supabase → Table Editor → profiles
- [ ] See `visibility` column (should show 'public' for existing)
- [ ] Run SQL: `SELECT visibility, COUNT(*) FROM profiles GROUP BY visibility;`
- [ ] Should show counts

### UI
- [ ] Privacy toggle visible in Edit Profile → Basic Info
- [ ] Toggle works (switches states)
- [ ] Badge updates (Public ↔ Private)
- [ ] Explanatory text changes
- [ ] Save button works

### Privacy
- [ ] Set profile to private
- [ ] Log in as different user
- [ ] Search for private profile (should appear)
- [ ] Click profile (should see "Private" message)
- [ ] Cannot see posts/stats
- [ ] Follow button visible

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Already Supported)

The system is designed to easily add:

### 1. Granular Privacy Controls
```
Profile Settings:
├─ Overall: Public/Private
├─ Media: Public/Private/Friends/Inherit
├─ Stats: Public/Private/Friends/Inherit
├─ Posts: Public/Private/Friends/Inherit
└─ Activity: Public/Private/Friends/Inherit
```

**How to add later:**
1. Update UI in EditProfileTabs.tsx
2. Use existing `privacy_settings` table
3. Update RLS policies to check granular settings
4. No schema changes needed!

### 2. Friends-Only Option
```
Visibility options:
- Public (anyone)
- Friends Only (not just followers)
- Private (no one)
```

### 3. Per-Sport Privacy
```
Profile public, but:
- Golf stats: Private
- Basketball stats: Public
```

All this is ready to go with minimal changes!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Privacy toggle doesn't save"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify SQL migration ran successfully
- Check Supabase logs

### "Private profiles still visible"
- Clear browser cache
- Check RLS policies applied:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
  ```
- Verify user is logged in

### "Toggle not appearing"
- Check file saved: `src/components/EditProfileTabs.tsx`
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
- Check browser console for errors

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### profiles table
```sql
visibility TEXT DEFAULT 'public' CHECK (visibility IN ('public', 'private'))
```

### privacy_settings table (future)
```sql
profile_id UUID (linked to profiles)
profile_visibility TEXT
media_visibility TEXT
stats_visibility TEXT
posts_visibility TEXT
activity_visibility TEXT
```

---

## 💡 Developer Notes

### Adding Privacy Check to New Features

When creating new profile-related features:

```typescript
import { canViewProfile } from '@/lib/privacy';

// Check if user can view
const privacyCheck = await canViewProfile(profileId, currentUserId);

if (!privacyCheck.canView) {
  // Show limited view or access denied
  return <PrivateProfileView profile={profile} />;
}

// Show full content
return <FullProfileView profile={profile} />;
```

### RLS Policies Pattern

All content tables follow this pattern:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Content respects profile privacy"
  FOR SELECT USING (
    -- Own content
    profile_id = auth.uid()
    OR
    -- Public profile content
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = content_table.profile_id
      AND profiles.visibility = 'public'
    )
    OR
    -- Private profile if following
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      JOIN follows ON follows.following_id = profiles.id
      WHERE profiles.id = content_table.profile_id
      AND profiles.visibility = 'private'
      AND follows.follower_id = auth.uid()
      AND follows.status = 'accepted'
    )
  );
```
